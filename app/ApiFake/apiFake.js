        postText: `Six weeks after the attacks of 7 October, with a punishing war in full swing, Jordan’s deputy prime minister issued a warning. “Hamas is an idea,” Ayman Safadi said. “It cannot be bombed out of existence.”

Despite seven months of bombardment – or perhaps because of it – Hamas is today one of the most important nationalist and Islamic movements in the world. Its enemies denounce it as the equivalent of Islamic State. Its supporters call it “the resistance”.

An offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that emerged from the refugee camps of Gaza in the 1980s, Hamas is an armed movement that seeks an independent and Islamic Palestinian state free from Israeli occupation. Its founders, such as the late sheikh Ahmed Yassin, were children of the Nakba, the Palestinian “catastrophe”, when about 750,000 people were forced from their homes in 1948 during the war that created Israel.

Though Hamas leaders first wanted to sow a “social jihad”, Islamising society to achieve their aims, the group embraced violence in the first intifada, seeing an opportunity to upstage Yasser Arafat’s secular Palestine Liberation Organisation and seize control of the uprising.

Its tactics have changed over the decades, but its ultimate aim has not. Hamas has used suicide bombers, rocket fire and even the ballot box to fight Israel and take power. In 2006 it won Palestine’s most recent elections. A year later, it seized control of the Gaza Strip. And last October, it staged an attack on southern Israeli communities in which it killed more than 1,100 people and took 240 others hostage. “Hamas can be excoriated,” warn Beverley Milton-Edwards and Stephen Farrell, “but it should not be underestimated.”`,

        postTitle: "Calum Finlay’s fast-moving comedy about the composer and her struggles to be recognised is pitch-perfectly performed",
        postText: `Felix is working out an idea at the piano. What does his sister Fanny think? It needs more contrast, more dissonance, she tells him and, settling herself at the keyboard, demonstrates her meaning. The melody she plays is familiar. We now know it as the wedding march, part of Felix Mendelssohn’s incidental music for A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Both Mendelssohn siblings were talented composers, conductors and performers, but, in the first half of the 19th century only one could expect to gain public recognition.

In his new, high-spirited, fantastical, quasi-period comedy, Calum Finlay plays off the contrasts of the possibilities open to each of the siblings by setting up a scenario where Fanny pretends to be Felix so as to take up an invitation to perform for Queen Victoria. Accompanied by her fiance, Willhelm (George Howard), and by another struggling female composer, Clara Schumann, she sets off across Europe, the women facing up to sexist encounters along the way. The furious Felix (Corey Montague-Sholay) follows in hot pursuit, along with their mother (Kim Ismay); the final-leg, accelerando, carriage race along the Mall is a Wacky Races-Ben-Hur mash up.

Finlay’s mix of farce, cartoon and pantomime, seriousness and sentiment is entertaining, from moment to moment, but too capriciously unstructured to be really satisfying. An excessive emphasis on fun disrupts the drama: instead of the action growing out of the interplay of the characters, it is too obviously shaped to service the needs of particular situations. This is especially apparent in the development of the relationship between Fanny and Clara (nonetheless invested with nuance by Charlie Russell and Jade May Lin, respectively).

Staging, under Katie-Ann McDonough’s direction, is witty and fast-paced, facilitated by Sophia Pardon’s designs (sight-and-sound gags deliver laughs and emotional impact). Yshani Perinpanayagam’s musical direction and additional compositions are both subtle and tonally effective. All six performers (last but not least, Harry Kershaw, in several roles) strike the right chords.`,

        postTitle: "Why do I keep falling in love with totally unavailable people? There may be unfinished business from your infancy or early childhood that you are trying to conclude by longing for something unobtainable",
        postText: `The question I’m at my wit’s end. I’m a 50-year-old gay man and I’m in a happy, long-term relationship. But I’ve fallen in love with a married straight guy 10 years my junior. He’s a new colleague at work. We get on well and have struck up a companionable working relationship, but my feelings for him have become deeper – and it’s agony.

I’m not an idiot. He’s married with young children and I know nothing is going to happen. I don’t think I’d even want it to, but I just can’t stop the intensity of my feelings for him. He’s a kind, thoughtful man, which somehow makes it worse. I couldn’t bear it if he found out I was secretly harbouring lustful or amorous feelings for him.

This is not the first time I’ve done this. Over the years there have been others that I’ve secretly fallen for, so I guess it’s a bit of a pattern. The first time was when I was at school at 14. I fell in love with a friend and my feelings were so intense I couldn’t tell anyone, not even him. I couldn’t even admit I was gay at that age. This current crush feels as bad as that. I know this sounds pathetic, but I feel absolutely broken by this. I’d like us to be friends, but how do I stop feeling jealous when he talks and laughs with others? How can I stop feeling these intense feelings?

Philippa’s answer One thing you might consider is to explore the underlying reasons for why you tend to develop these intense crushes on unavailable people. It sounds like this has been a pattern for you since childhood, so understanding the roots of this behaviour could help you gain insight into your psyche. And insight can lead to healing. I’m going to suggest a few reasons that might be the cause, in case any resonate with you.

It could be that somewhere in your infancy and childhood you got confused between longing, which is agony, and love, which is bliss or at least comfortable. It sounds like you are a lifelong sufferer of intermittent limerence. Limerence is a term coined by Dorothy Tennov in 1979. It’s when otherwise healthy individuals find themselves in a monomania for another person, which they might not have expected to happen and when they recover from the experience their lives go back to normal… until the next time. The experience is distinct from simple sexual desire – it’s more obsessive.`,

        postTitle: "George Cottrell, who was jailed in US for wire fraud, has been seen at Reform UK leader’s side over the last week",
        postText: `Nigel Farage is facing questions over why he is being accompanied on the campaign trail by an aristocratic friend who spent eight months in jail in the US for wire fraud.

Known as “Posh George”, George Cottrell was a volunteer for Farage in 2016 before his arrest in the US on money-laundering charges and ultimate guilty plea to one count of wire fraud in a case unrelated to his work at Ukip, Farage’s party at the time. The crime was committed in 2014, before Cottrell worked for either the anti-EU party or Farage.

Cottrell served eight months after a plea agreement that reduced his possible prison sentence from a maximum of 20 years, according to court documents at the time.

He has been seen at Farage’s side on the campaign trail over the last week, including the day the Reform UK leader was hit by a milkshake thrown by a member of the public.

Farage, who made a surprise return as leader of Reform UK a week ago, appeared to brush off questions about his association with Cottrell when asked about it on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg. “Firstly, I always stand by my friends,” he said.

“Secondly, there is a thing called Christian forgiveness. If people get convicted or do something wrong, well, they have another chance in life to go on and prove themselves.”

Reform said Cottrell had no official role in Farage’s campaign and was an unpaid volunteer.

Farage is expected to announce more policies for Reform on Monday, a week after deciding to take over from Richard Tice as leader.

He told the BBC on Sunday that he supported raising the personal tax allowance to £20,000 a year and raising the inheritance tax threshold to £2m – huge tax cuts that would cost many billions. Farage claimed that he would be able to carry out £50bn in spending cuts and through tax changes.`,
